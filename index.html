        Direct customer engagement should one of your top priorities.
        Most businesses choose to go with in-direct engagement – such as FAQs. 
        This is not the most effective way to engage.
        Direct engagement, on the other hand, makes use of live chat, forums and help centers – 
        where customer service representatives are present all the time to make sure every query is handled properly.
        More engaged customers results in better word-of-mouth and more leads.
        According to the stats, outbound marketing is still more effective than inbound marketing. But, 
        it doesn’t mean that you forget about inbound marketing. Look to deploy both approaches in a 
        balanced manner as this will be helpful in generating leads and eventually your business.
        From an inbound perspective – personalize your email communication and get active  in 
        online communities by regularly sharing informative content, as well as solving common 
        customer problems. This will  help you establish healthy relationships with your 
        customers and build more leads.

                What about a tool for getting more Users?
                Drip is an application that offers marketing automation through the form of a well-designed popup,
                 email marketing and more. You can collect the information of your prospective customers and turn 
                 them into genuine leads on autopilot.
                Another lead generation task you should consider automating is your social media marketing. 
                For example, Jeff Bullas uses social media management tool Agorapulse to automate his Twitter activity.
                The process includes these key steps.
